    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My daughter and I created this breakfast casserole for Father's Day. It's easy to make in a short amount of time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package bulk pork sausage</li>
            <li>3 cups frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refrigerated buttermilk biscuit dough (such as Pillsbury Grands!)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage; cook and stir until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in hash brown potatoes; cook and stir until potatoes are browned, about 5 more minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with a layer of buttermilk biscuits, splitting the biscuits in half to completely cover the dish. Spread sausage and hash brown mixture evenly over top, then sprinkle with Mexican cheese. Whisk together eggs and milk in a bowl, and pour over cheese.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until eggs are set, about 25 minutes.</p>
